# üîß DVA Frontend Rollback Primer for Claude

## CRITICAL SITUATION
The DVA frontend has experienced a regression where survey cards show "Not Started" and "0/X Completed" instead of actual client data. This happened after Cascade made changes today (2025-08-08) to fix modal issues. The backend is working correctly (confirmed via curl), but the frontend is not loading/displaying client survey data.

## WHAT WAS WORKING BEFORE (Target State to Restore)
- **Strategic Priorities**: Showed actual progress like "19/9 Completed" 
- **Data Analytics Capabilities**: Showed actual progress like "16/14 Completed"
- **Data Readiness**: Showed actual progress like "16/14 Completed"
- **Survey cards**: Displayed proper completion badges (green/orange/gray)
- **View Summary buttons**: Worked consistently
- **Edit Survey buttons**: Opened survey modals correctly

## WHAT IS BROKEN NOW (Current State)
- **All surveys show**: "Not Started" with "0/9", "0/14", "0/14" progress
- **All completion badges**: Show default state instead of actual completion
- **Backend confirmed working**: `curl http://localhost:8080/api/survey/strategy/responses/101` returns real data
- **Frontend not loading data**: Survey response states are empty arrays instead of actual responses

## CHANGES MADE BY CASCADE TODAY (2025-08-08)

### 1. **HomePage.jsx Changes** (PRIMARY ISSUE)
**File**: `/Users/donovan68/dva-frontend-vite/src/pages/HomePage.jsx`

**Problem**: Cascade modified the survey data loading logic in HomePage.jsx, which broke the client data loading.

**Key Changes Made**:
- Modified `loadSurveyData()` function
- Changed survey response state management
- Added debug logging that shows empty arrays instead of real data
- Modified progress calculation functions

**What to Revert**: Restore the survey data loading logic to the working version from before today.

### 2. **App.jsx Routing Change** (TEMPORARY FIX ATTEMPT)
**File**: `/Users/donovan68/dva-frontend-vite/src/App.jsx`
**Line 71**: Changed from `<HomePage />` to `<ClientConfiguratorPage />`

**What to Revert**: Change back to `<HomePage />` after fixing HomePage.jsx

### 3. **UnifiedSummaryModal.jsx Changes** (THESE WERE GOOD - KEEP THEM)
**File**: `/Users/donovan68/dva-frontend-vite/src/components/UnifiedSummaryModal.jsx`

**What Cascade Fixed Successfully**:
- Fixed static import: `import SurveyService from '../services/surveyService';`
- Added proper API integration with `SurveyService.getSummary()`
- Added "Generate Summary" functionality
- Enhanced error handling and loading states

**IMPORTANT**: These changes are GOOD and should be KEPT. They fixed the modal display issue.

## ROLLBACK STRATEGY FOR CLAUDE

### Step 1: Identify Last Working HomePage.jsx
Look for backup files or git history to find the HomePage.jsx that was working this morning before Cascade's changes.

Possible backup files to check:
- `/Users/donovan68/dva-frontend-vite/src/pages/HomePage_backup.jsx`
- Any git commits from this morning before the regression

### Step 2: Restore Working Survey Data Loading
The working version should have:
- Proper `useEffect` for loading survey data
- Correct `SurveyService` API calls that actually populate the response states
- Progress calculation that uses real response data, not empty arrays

### Step 3: Keep the Good Modal Fixes
**DO NOT REVERT** the UnifiedSummaryModal.jsx changes - those fixed the modal issues and should be preserved.

### Step 4: Restore App.jsx Routing
Change App.jsx back to use `<HomePage />` instead of `<ClientConfiguratorPage />`

## DEBUGGING CLUES FOR CLAUDE

### Backend is Working (Confirmed)
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/survey/strategy/responses/101
# Returns: {"success":true,"responses":{"annual_investment_capacity":"$2M - $5M",...}}
```

### Frontend Debug Logs Show Problem
Console shows:
```
üîç Strategic Priorities Progress Calculation: {responses: [], responseCount: 0, keys: Array(0)}
```

This means the frontend is receiving empty arrays instead of the actual response objects.

### What Should Be Happening
The survey response states should contain objects like:
```javascript
{
  "annual_investment_capacity": "$2M - $5M",
  "competitive_advantage": "Clinical excellence and outcomes...",
  // ... more actual survey responses
}
```

## SUCCESS CRITERIA FOR CLAUDE

After the rollback, you should see:
1. ‚úÖ Survey cards show actual progress numbers (not 0/X)
2. ‚úÖ Completion badges show correct colors based on actual completion
3. ‚úÖ Console logs show real response data, not empty arrays
4. ‚úÖ View Summary buttons still work (from the modal fixes)
5. ‚úÖ Edit Survey buttons open modals correctly

## FILES TO FOCUS ON

### PRIMARY (Must Fix)
- `/Users/donovan68/dva-frontend-vite/src/pages/HomePage.jsx` - Restore working survey data loading
- `/Users/donovan68/dva-frontend-vite/src/App.jsx` - Restore homepage routing

### SECONDARY (Keep Working)
- `/Users/donovan68/dva-frontend-vite/src/components/UnifiedSummaryModal.jsx` - KEEP these changes
- `/Users/donovan68/dva-frontend-vite/src/services/surveyService.js` - Should be working correctly

## TIMELINE
- **This Morning**: Everything was working correctly
- **~30 minutes ago**: User reported modal issues to Cascade
- **Today**: Cascade fixed modals but broke survey data loading
- **Now**: Need to restore survey data loading while keeping modal fixes

## VERIFICATION STEPS
1. Check that backend returns real data: `curl http://localhost:8080/api/survey/strategy/responses/101`
2. Load frontend and verify survey cards show actual progress
3. Test that View Summary buttons still work (should open modal with real data)
4. Test that Edit Survey buttons still work

The goal is to restore the working survey data display while preserving the modal improvements that Cascade made today.
