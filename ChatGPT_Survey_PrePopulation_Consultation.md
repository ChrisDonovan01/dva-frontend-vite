# ChatGPT Consultation: React Survey Pre-Population Bug

## Problem Summary
The StrategicPrioritiesSurvey React component is not pre-populating with existing survey responses, even though the backend API is working correctly and returning the right data.

## Current Status

### ✅ Backend Working Correctly
- API endpoint: `GET /api/survey/strategy/responses/101`
- Returns: `{"success": true, "responses": {"strategic_priority": "Improve patient outcomes", ...}, "completed": false}`
- All 9 questions have responses with consistent question IDs matching BigQuery table

### ✅ Frontend Data Loading Working
- ClientConfiguratorPage successfully loads survey data from backend
- Console logs show: `Strategy data loaded - keys: [strategic_priority, competitive_advantage, ...]`
- `initialResponses` prop is correctly passed to StrategicPrioritiesSurvey component

### ❌ Survey Component Pre-Population Not Working
- Survey modal opens with questions loaded dynamically from BigQuery
- Questions display correctly but no radio buttons are pre-selected
- Console logs show the component is receiving the data but not applying it

## Key Console Log Evidence

```javascript
// Component receives correct data:
initialResponses: {strategic_priority: "Improve patient outcomes", competitive_advantage: "Clinical excellence...", ...}
responses state: {strategic_priority: "Improve patient outcomes", competitive_advantage: "Clinical excellence...", ...}

// But radio button logic fails:
currentQuestion?.question_id: strategic_priority
Radio Debug for "Improve patient outcomes":
  - responses[qid]: undefined (type: undefined)
  - currentValue (final): undefined (type: undefined)
  - EXACT COMPARISON: undefined === "Improve patient outcomes"
  - isChecked: false
```

## The Core Issue
The component is receiving the response data correctly in `initialResponses` and `responses` state, but when it tries to check if a radio button should be selected, it's getting `undefined` instead of the expected value.

## Component Structure
- Questions loaded dynamically from BigQuery via `SurveyService.loadStrategyQuestions()`
- Responses loaded via `initialResponses` prop from parent component
- Component uses `currentQuestion.question_id` to look up response values
- Radio buttons should be checked when `responses[question_id] === option_value`

## Request for ChatGPT
Please analyze this React component pre-population issue and provide specific guidance on:

1. **Root Cause Analysis**: Why is `responses[qid]` returning `undefined` when the data clearly exists?
2. **React State Management**: Are there any common React patterns or hooks issues that could cause this?
3. **Component Lifecycle**: Could there be a timing issue with when the data is available vs when the component renders?
4. **Debugging Strategy**: What specific debugging steps should we take to isolate the exact point of failure?
5. **Code Fix Recommendations**: What changes should be made to ensure proper pre-population?

## Additional Context
- Using React with Vite
- Component uses multiple useEffect hooks for data loading
- Questions and responses are loaded asynchronously from different API endpoints
- Component has loading states to handle async data loading
- This is a modal component that opens when user clicks "Edit" button

## Expected Behavior
When the survey modal opens, the radio button for "Improve patient outcomes" should be pre-selected for the first question, and all other questions should show their saved responses as well.
