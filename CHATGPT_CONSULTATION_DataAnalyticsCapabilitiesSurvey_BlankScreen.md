# ChatGPT Consultation: DataAnalyticsCapabilitiesSurvey Blank Screen Bug

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUE
DataAnalyticsCapabilitiesSurvey component renders a **blank white screen** when opened, despite successful data loading and multiple fix attempts.

## 📊 CONSOLE EVIDENCE

### Error Logs:
```
[warn] An error occurred in the <DataAnalyticsCapabilitiesSurvey> component. Consider adding an error boundary to your tree to customize error handling behavior.
```

### Successful Data Loading (but component still crashes):
```
[log] 📋 DataAnalyticsCapabilitiesSurvey: questions.length: 14
[log] 🔢 DataAnalyticsCapabilitiesSurvey: currentQuestionIndex: 0
[log] ❓ DataAnalyticsCapabilitiesSurvey: currentQuestion: {question_id: infrastructure_rating, question_text: How would you rate your organization's current data infrastructure and analytics platform capabilities?, response_type: likert_1_5, section: Technology Infrastructure, choices: Array(5)}
[log] 🎯 DataAnalyticsCapabilitiesSurvey: currentQuestion?.question_id: infrastructure_rating
[log] ✅ Loaded questions: [Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object]
```

## 🔍 CURRENT STATE

### ✅ Working Component: StrategicPrioritiesSurvey
- Opens correctly with professional left navigation sidebar
- Pre-populates responses with blue highlighting
- Same structure and patterns as DataAnalyticsCapabilitiesSurvey

### ❌ Broken Component: DataAnalyticsCapabilitiesSurvey
- Blank white screen (React error boundary triggered)
- Data loads successfully but component crashes during render
- Identical structure to working component

## 🛠️ ATTEMPTED FIXES (All Failed)

1. **Added missing 'likert_1_5' response type handler** - Still blank screen
2. **Verified component imports and syntax** - No build errors
3. **Checked for JSX syntax errors** - None found
4. **Verified questions loading logic** - Working correctly
5. **Replaced entire component with working structure** - Still crashes

## 📁 KEY FILES

### DataAnalyticsCapabilitiesSurvey.jsx (BROKEN)
```javascript
// Component structure identical to working StrategicPrioritiesSurvey
// Has handlers for: radio, checkbox, textarea, likert_1_5
// Data loads successfully but crashes during render
```

### StrategicPrioritiesSurvey.jsx (WORKING REFERENCE)
```javascript
// Same patterns, same structure, works perfectly
// Professional left nav sidebar, pre-population, etc.
```

## 🎯 QUESTIONS FOR CHATGPT

1. **Root Cause Analysis**: What could cause a React component to trigger error boundary despite successful data loading and no apparent syntax errors?

2. **Debugging Strategy**: What's the best approach to isolate the exact line/logic causing the React error in DataAnalyticsCapabilitiesSurvey?

3. **Component Comparison**: What should I look for when comparing the working StrategicPrioritiesSurvey vs broken DataAnalyticsCapabilitiesSurvey?

4. **React Error Patterns**: What are common causes of blank screen with error boundary trigger in React components?

5. **Immediate Fix**: What's the fastest way to get DataAnalyticsCapabilitiesSurvey working with the same UI as StrategicPrioritiesSurvey?

## 🚀 DESIRED OUTCOME

DataAnalyticsCapabilitiesSurvey should:
- Open with professional left navigation sidebar (matching StrategicPrioritiesSurvey)
- Display questions with proper response type handling
- Pre-populate existing responses with blue highlighting
- No blank screen or React errors

## 💡 ADDITIONAL CONTEXT

- Both components use identical patterns and structure
- Data loading works perfectly (14 questions, responses, etc.)
- Issue appears to be in render logic, not data fetching
- User has confirmed issue persists after all attempted fixes
- This is blocking the survey workflow functionality
